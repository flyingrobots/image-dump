- âœ… Phase Complete
- ðŸ“‹ Phase Planned
- [x] Task Complete
- [ ] Task Pending

## Current Status
**Phases 1-3 Complete!** The project now has:
- Robust image optimization with multiple format support
- Advanced processing capabilities including Git LFS integration
- Comprehensive configuration system with per-image quality rules
- Error recovery and progress tracking
- Full test coverage and CI/CD pipeline

**Next:** Phase 4 will focus on security and validation to prepare for production use.

## Implementation Notes

### Metadata Preservation Enhancement
The current metadata preservation implementation supports only boolean values (all or nothing). A future enhancement will add selective preservation, allowing users to specify which metadata fields to keep (e.g., preserve copyright while removing GPS data).

### Cross-Phase Dependencies
- **Phase 4 & 5**: Rate limiting spans both phases - basic implementation in Phase 4, full API integration in Phase 5
- **Phase 5 & 8**: API monitoring requires the web interface to be in place
- **Phase 6**: Developer tools can be built independently and in parallel with other phases
- **Phase 9**: AI features require the advanced processing capabilities from Phase 7 and infrastructure from Phase 8

### Success Metrics
Each phase has specific success criteria:
- **Phase 4**: Zero security vulnerabilities, <5% performance impact
- **Phase 5**: API response times <200ms, 99.9% uptime
- **Phase 6**: Developer adoption rate >50%, positive feedback
- **Phase 7**: Support for 95% of common image formats
- **Phase 8**: Complete observability, automated alerting
- **Phase 9**: AI processing accuracy >90%, significant file size reduction
